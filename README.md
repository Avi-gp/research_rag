# 🧠 ResearchMind
RAG-Powered Research Paper Q&A and Summarization System

## 📌 Overview
**ResearchMind** is a modern **Streamlit + FastAPI** application that helps researchers:
- 📤 Upload and process research papers (PDFs)  
- ❓ Ask AI-powered questions with citations & similarity scores  
- 📋 Generate smart summaries (executive, key findings, methodology, etc.)  
- 📊 Monitor system statistics and embeddings  
- 🗂 Manage stored PDFs and vector databases

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/Avi-gp/research_rag.git'

cd research_rag
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
python api/main.py
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Frontend (Streamlit)
```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

### 🔑 Features

✅ Upload multiple research papers (PDFs)

✅ RAG-based Q&A with similarity threshold tuning

✅ Generate focused or comprehensive summaries
